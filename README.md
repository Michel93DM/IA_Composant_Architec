# AI Component Evaluation – IAC MS at CentraleSupélec

This repository presents the evaluation framework for the AI component developed as part of the IAC MS program at CentraleSupélec.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 🔧 Architecture
Contains the complete architecture of the AI component, covering:
- Training phase
- Evaluation phase
- Operational runtime
- Online runtime monitoring
- Feedback loop for continuous improvement
- The Folder contains an image illustrating the architecture.

### 📊 Datasets
Includes datasets relevant to the development and evaluation of the AI component:
- **Standard datasets** for initial model training. 
- **Augmented datasets** to improve robustness and performance, i present several examples of Augmented datasets to deal with different case of perturbation like noise, rotation..

### 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Defines and tracks essential KPIs to ensure:
- Trustworthiness
- Robustness
- User-friendliness
of the deployed AI component

Finally, i present some improvment actions that could be made to improve both automation and performance of the component.
